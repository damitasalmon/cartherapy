                                <p class="card-text">Ash Saunders, a born and raised Long Islander, has always been super creative and active. It is the reason why she chose to pursue the entertainment industry as a child and furthered her study of the craft at Hampton University. She received her Bachelor in Performance Art, and from there, she landed an internship in Los Angeles- and the rest is history. The deeper she journeyed into the industry, the deeper her love grew working not only on camera but behind the scenes as well. Aside from acting, writing, and directing, she also enjoys DIY projects, cooking, and fashion design. Her life’s motto is, "It’s either a lesson or a blessing. Remember perspective is key". Ash’s hope for herself is to continue making|strides within the entertainment industry, and experiencing all that life has to offer.</p>
